This is the directory for the APPM 4600 Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing class.
There are 2 main directories here, Homeworks and Labs.
Homeworks contains the homework done for the class.
Labs contain works done in each lab.
Each individual homework and lab also has its own directory.
Have fun exploring!
